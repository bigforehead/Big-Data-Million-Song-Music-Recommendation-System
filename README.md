# Song Recommendation Systems

Inspired by Discover Weekly playlist from Spotify, we, a geek group of music lovers, explored recommendation algorithms and built two personalized song recommenders. One gives users a playlist based on their listening history, and the other one recommends song based on lyric.<br>
The <b> RS Code </b> folder contains 3 jupyter notebooks for collaborative filtering recommendation system, lyric-based recommendation system, and lyric visualization.<br>
The <b> Data Preprocessing </b> folder contains 2 jupyter notebook for data extracting and aggregration.<br>
